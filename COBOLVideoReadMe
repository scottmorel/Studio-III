#COBOL Video Readme
This is the readme file for my COBOL video presentation.  I chose to do a presentation on COBOL because my dad used to talk about it when I was growing up.  I learned that it is a language that was mainly used by businesses back in the day.  One thing I wish I had done was taken more time to learn more of the commands and do some more advanced things with the language.
