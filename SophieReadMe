#Sophie ReadMe
This is a read me for the Sophie.png project.  This was a project using Photoshop to create an image.  I chose to create an image revolving
around my dog Sophie.  If I had to improve anything I would have taken more time to learn some of the more advanced PS techniques to make
things look more professional.
